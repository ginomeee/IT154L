Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) Disk Scheduling Algorithm

Programmed by: Juan Dela Cruz
MP07 - SSTF DISK SCHEDULING ALGORITHM

Inputs:
Max Cylinder Size: 200
Head Pointer Position: 53
Queue: 98 183 37 122 14 124 65 67 -1

Output:
Graph
Table

Do you want to run again [y/n]:

Grading:
---------
Graph -                20
Correct Total Cyl -         40
Correct Average            40
                               ------
                                100 


Screen Output - 50%

FileOutput -50% (append the output on the input file)

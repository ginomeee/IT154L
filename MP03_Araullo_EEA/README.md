PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Create a console program that would simulate the Multilevel Queing Scheduling Algorithm. Refer to the sample run below. Inputs should be fetched from a file. The output should be displayed on the screen and should be appended on the input file.
Use the attached file checker as source of input for testing purposes. Your program should not be limited to the values on the file checker. It should vary.

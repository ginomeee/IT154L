## Instructions

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Create a console program that would simulate the First-Come First Serve CPU Scheduling Algorithm. Refer to the sample run below. Inputs should be fetched from a file. The output should be displayed on the screen and should be appended on the input file. Use only C++, Java, and Python.
Use the attached file checker as source of input for testing purposes. Your program should not be limited to the values on the file checker. It should vary.
